2 big datasets: 

- 'df10labeled_data.csv': 
	-> label dataset including preprocessed markers for each 10-second time window, mission and participant; this dataset will be useful for classification purposes	2 children datasets: 
	-> Granularity= No clear granularity; many rows corresponding to same subject-mission-mode.
	1 child dataset:
		* 'df10PMPV_perf_data_to_class.csv' has the mission scores.
		

- 'averagedPMPVmode_w10_data.csv': 
	-> labeled dataset with averaged or summed markers results for each 10-second time window, mission, participant and robot operation mode
	-> Granularity= mission & mode
	2 children datasets: 
		* 'averagedPMPV_w10_data.csv' 
		* averagedPMPV_data.csv

		
Each subject does 4 missions. During the mission, the game switches from the manual mode and the automatic mode.
